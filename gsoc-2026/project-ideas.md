# DLang GSoC 2026 Project Ideas

D is a general-purpose programming language with static typing, systems-level access, and C-like syntax.
With the D Programming Language, write fast, read fast, and run fast.

D allows writing large code fragments without redundantly specifying types, like dynamic languages do.
On the other hand, static inference deduces types and other code properties, giving the best of both the static and the dynamic worlds.

Automatic memory management makes for safe, simple, and robust code.
D also supports scoped resource management (aka the RAII idiom) and scope statements for deterministic transactional code that is easy to write and read.

Built-in linear and associative arrays, slices, and ranges make daily programming simple and pleasant for tasks, both small and large.

D offers an innovative approach to concurrency, featuring true immutable data, message passing, no sharing by default, and controlled mutable sharing across threads.

From simple scripts to large projects, D has the breadth to scale with any application's needs: unit testing, information hiding, refined modularity, fast compilation, precise interfaces.
